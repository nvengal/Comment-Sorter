When you open the zip you should see a ReadMe.txt file. 
That file contains the instructions on how to run the program. 
I tried my best to make sure all the bugs were ironed out, 
but without having real data to test it on I'm not fully confident that 
it will work perfectly the first time. Let me know if you see any lines 
that say "ERROR" when the program is running or if the spreadsheets look weird.
